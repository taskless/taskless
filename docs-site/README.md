# Taskless Docs Site (OSS)

_ A companion to `/docs` for testing and verifying changes_

## Referencing Files

Files are referenced by their repository path, minus the `.md` extension. So, for example, a URL of`/docs/sample/here-or-there` will resolve to `/docs/sample/here-or-there.md`. This 1:1 mapping makes it easy to reason about the files and directories, encouraging a folder when a deeper dive into a topic is needed.
