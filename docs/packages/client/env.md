# Taskless Environment Variables

Most options in Taskless can be represented via [Environment Variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) or colloquially "env" values. Env values are not committed to your repository and often contain sensitive information such as secrets. Most deployment targets including Vercel, Heroku, and Netlify all allow you to specify env values as part of your app's configuration.

Taskless recommends storing the bulk of your configuration in env values.

- `TASKLESS_ID` (example: `abcdef...000001`) Your project's unique ID from Taskless.io
- `TASKLESS_SECRET` (example: `xgt1_aBCd612...`) Your project's secret token from Taskless.io
- `TASKLESS_BASE_URL` (example: `http://localhost:1234`) Defines the protocol, domain, and port for your application
- `TASKLESS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (example: `alonguniquestring...`) Your encryption key for end-to-end encryption
- `TASKLESS_PREVIOUS_SECRETS` (example: `xgt1_abc,xgt1_def`) Previous application secrets, comma separated
- `TASKLESS_PREVIOUS_ENCRYPTION_KEYS` (example: `key1,key2...`) Previous encryption keys, comma separated

> Note: In Taskless@2.x.x, the environment variables `TASKLESS_APP_SECRET` and `TASKLESS_PREVIOUS_APP_SECRETS` were used to refer to the per-queue secret. This was removed in v3 in favor of a project-level ID & Secret.

**Development ENV Values** Additionally, the following env values may be useful in development.

- `TASKLESS_ENV` (example: `development`) Used to override the `NODE_ENV` value, specifically for Taskless
- `TASKLESS_ENDPOINT` (example: `http://localhost:8080/api/graphql`) Changes the GraphQL endpoint used by the client. When not set, Taskless will select a default URL based on the value of `process.env.TASKLESS_ENV ?? process.env.NODE_ENV`. Changing this value is useful if you are running the Taskless Dev Server on a different port or for sending jobs to your production Taskless instance. The default endpoints are:
  - **development** `http://localhost:8080/api/graphql`
  - **production** `https://for.taskless.io/api/graphql`
