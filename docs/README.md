# Introduction to Taskless

Welcome to Taskless! Taskless is designed to take the infrastructure pain out of setting up and maintaining a Job Queueing system, and excels in a serverless or edge-function environment. It can be used anywhere you've got publicly reachable URLs and wish to call them on a schedule or in response to a user action.

The fastest way to get started with Taskless is to follow a guide for your JavaScript framework. Each guide comes with an integration example from the [Taskless repository](https://github.com/taskless/taskless/tree/main/examples).

- **Next.js** [Guide](/docs/get-started/nextjs.md) | [Example](https://github.com/taskless/taskless/tree/main/examples/next)
- **Express** [Guide](/docs/get-started/express.md) | [Example](https://github.com/taskless/taskless/tree/main/examples/express)
- **Taskless Queue** [Guide](/docs/get-started/other.md) (for integrations not covered above)

> â„¹ **TypeScript Tip**
> All examples are written in TypeScript, to provide additional hints about what is going on inside of Taskless. All of Taskless works with regular JS as well!
